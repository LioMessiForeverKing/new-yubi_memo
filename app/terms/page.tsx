      <h2>5. Integrations and Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Asteri may integrate with external platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, or Pinterest to enhance
        personalization and functionality. By connecting such accounts, you grant Asteri permission to
        access limited data as allowed by each platform’s API. Asteri complies with each platform’s
        developer and privacy requirements and allows you to revoke access at any time through your
        settings.
      </p>
      <p>We are not responsible for the content, privacy practices, or terms of third-party services.</p>

      <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        All intellectual property rights in the Services — including software, algorithms, and design —
        belong to Asteri or its licensors. You may not copy, reproduce, modify, or distribute any part of
        the Services without prior written consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        You retain ownership of any content you upload or share through the Services, but you grant
        Asteri a non-exclusive, royalty-free, limited license to use that content for the purpose of
        providing and improving the Services.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Privacy and Data</h2>
      <p>
        Your use of the Services is subject to our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which explains
        how we collect, use, and safeguard your data. By using the Services, you consent to the
        processing and storage of your data as described in that policy.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Service Changes and Availability</h2>
      <p>
        We may update, modify, or discontinue features at any time. We strive to maintain uptime and
        stability, but Asteri does not guarantee uninterrupted access. We may also release beta features
        that are experimental and may contain bugs or errors.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>The Services are provided “as is” and “as available.” Asteri disclaims all warranties,</p>
      <p>
        express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
        and non-infringement.
      </p>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Asteri is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.</li>
        <li>
          Our total liability for any claim arising out of or relating to the Services will not exceed
          <strong> $100 USD </strong> or the amount you paid us in the past 12 months, whichever is
          greater.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow these limitations, so they may not apply to you.</p>

      <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Asteri, its affiliates, officers, employees, and
        contractors from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from your use of the Services, your
        content, or your violation of these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the <strong>State of
        Delaware</strong>, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>
      <p>
        Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the
        Services will be resolved exclusively through <strong>binding arbitration</strong> administered by
        the <strong>American Arbitration Association (AAA)</strong> under its Consumer Arbitration Rules.
      </p>
      <p>You agree that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Arbitration will be conducted in English in Delaware, USA.</li>
        <li>Each party will bear its own arbitration costs.</li>
        <li>The arbitrator’s decision will be final and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By agreeing to these Terms, you waive any right to a jury trial.</p>

      <h2>13. Class Action Waiver</h2>
      <p>You agree that any disputes must be resolved on an individual basis.</p>
      <p>
        You may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, or
        representative proceeding. Arbitration or court proceedings may only address your individual
        claims, and no arbitrator may consolidate or join multiple users’ claims.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms, misuse our Services, or
        engage in activities that harm the platform or other users. You may terminate your account at any
        time by contacting <a href="mailto:support@asteri.ai">support@asteri.ai</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>15. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may modify these Terms from time to time to reflect product or legal changes. If we make
        significant updates, we’ll notify you via email or in-app notice. Continued use of the Services
        after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.
      </p>
