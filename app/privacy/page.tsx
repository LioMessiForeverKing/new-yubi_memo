      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 2025</p>
      <p><strong>Company:</strong> Asteri Labs, Inc. (“Asteri,” “we,” “us,” or “our”)</p>

      <p>
        At Asteri, we build technology that remembers you — safely, privately, and with your full
        control. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information
        when you use our applications, websites, and related services (collectively, the “Services”).
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect only the information needed to provide and improve our Services. This includes:</p>

      <h3>1.1. Information You Provide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Account details such as your name, email address, and profile preferences.</li>
        <li>
          Optional information such as connected social profiles (YouTube, TikTok, Pinterest) or
          additional data you choose to link.
        </li>
        <li>Messages or feedback you share with us.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1.2. Information From Connected Platforms</h3>
      <p>
        If you choose to connect platforms like YouTube or TikTok, we may access limited behavioral
        data (e.g., watch history, likes, saved items, or content preferences) through their official
        APIs. This information is used strictly to personalize your experience and is never sold or
        shared with third parties.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3. Device and Usage Data</h3>
      <p>
        We may collect basic technical data such as device type, operating system, IP address, app
        version, and usage patterns for analytics, crash reports, and service improvement.
      </p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>We use your information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Deliver personalized and proactive AI experiences tailored to your preferences.</li>
        <li>
          Build and maintain your “Asteri Memory Layer” — a private, user-controlled dataset that powers
          personalization.
        </li>
        <li>Improve product features, performance, and reliability.</li>
        <li>Communicate updates, invitations, or relevant information (with your consent).</li>
        <li>Ensure compliance with legal obligations and protect against misuse.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your data is never used for advertising or profiling without explicit consent.</p>

      <h2>3. Data Ownership and Control</h2>
      <p>You always own your data. Asteri operates on the principle of <strong>user-owned memory</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can view, edit, export, or delete your data at any time.</li>
        <li>Your memory is private and only used within your Asteri-connected apps.</li>
        <li>We do not share personal data with advertisers or third parties without explicit, written permission.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use industry-standard encryption (AES-256, TLS 1.3) for data at rest and in transit. Access
        to user data is strictly limited to authorized personnel under confidentiality agreements.
      </p>
      <p>
        All data is stored on secure servers within the United States or regions compliant with GDPR
        standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a data breach occurs, users will be notified promptly and transparently in accordance with
        applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain user data only as long as necessary to provide our Services or as required by law.
        Users may request deletion of their account and all associated data at any time by contacting
        <a href="mailto:privacy@asteri.ai">privacy@asteri.ai</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Third-Party Integrations</h2>
      <p>
        Our integrations with YouTube, TikTok, Pinterest, and similar platforms comply with their API
        terms and privacy policies. You can revoke these connections at any time from your account
        settings.
      </p>
      <p>We do not collect or store passwords from these platforms.</p>

      <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Asteri does not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under the age of 13 (or 16 in the
        EU). If we learn that we have inadvertently collected such data, we will delete it immediately.
      </p>

      <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        If you access our Services from outside the United States, please note that your data may be
        transferred and processed in jurisdictions that may not provide the same level of protection as
        your home country. We use appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses) to
        protect your data.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Depending on your location, you may have the right to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access the data we hold about you.</li>
        <li>Request corrections or deletions.</li>
        <li>Object to or restrict processing.</li>
        <li>Export your data to another platform.</li>
        <li>Withdraw consent at any time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@asteri.ai">privacy@asteri.ai</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect product or legal changes. When we
        do, we’ll update the “Last Updated” date and notify users via email or in-app notice where
        appropriate.
